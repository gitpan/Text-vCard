Stuff still todo:

More tests all round!

Supply 'types' of addresses, emails etc required.

Take a scalar or an array, return the 'pref' if possible or the right order.

e.g.

  foreach my $address ( $card->addresses(['home','postal']) {
    $address->boo;
  }
- and/or -
  foreach my $address ( $card->addresses('home') {
    $address->boo;
  }

Adding addresses, emails and other eliments belonging to a list

  $card->address_new(
    'street' => "74 Bayswater",
    'city' => "Ottawa",
    'type' => [ 'home', 'work' ],
  );
- or -
  my $new_address = $card->address_new;
  $new_address->street( "74 Bayswater" );
  $new_address->city("ottawa");
  ....


my $agents = $vcard->agent();
